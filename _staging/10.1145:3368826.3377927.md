abstract: Static analyses compute properties of programs that are true in all executions, and compilers use these properties to justify optimizations such
  as dead code elimination. Each static analysis in a compiler should be as precise as possible while remaining sound and being sufficiently fast. Unsound
  static analyses typically lead to miscompilations, whereas imprecisions typically lead to missed optimizations. Neither kind of bug is easy to track down.  Our
  research uses formal methods to help compiler developers create better static analyses. Our contribution is the design and evaluation of several algorithms
  for computing sound and maximally precise static analysis results using an SMT solver. These methods are too slow to use at compile time, but they can
  be used offline to find soundness and precision errors in a production compiler such as LLVM. We found no new soundness bugs in LLVM, but we can discover
  previously-fixed soundness errors that we re-introduced into the code base. We identified many imprecisions in LLVM's static analyses, some of which have
  been fixed as a result of our work.
