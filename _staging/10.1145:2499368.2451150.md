abstract: We formulate the loop-free binary superoptimization task as a stochastic search problem. The competing constraints of transformation correctness
  and performance improvement are encoded as terms in a cost function, and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler is used to rapidly explore the space of all
  possible programs to find one that is an optimization of a given target program. Although our method sacrifices completeness, the scope of programs we
  are able to consider, and the resulting quality of the programs that we produce, far exceed those of existing superoptimizers. Beginning from binaries
  compiled by llvm -O0 for 64-bit x86, our prototype implementation, STOKE, is able to produce programs which either match or outperform the code produced
  by gcc -O3, icc -O3, and in some cases, expert handwritten assembly.
