abstract: This paper describes a system that automatically generates peephole optimizations. A general peephole optimizer driven by a machine description
  produces optimizations at compile-compile time for a fast, pattern-directed, compile-time optimizer. They form part of a compiler that simplifies retargeting
  by substituting peephole optimization for case analysis.
