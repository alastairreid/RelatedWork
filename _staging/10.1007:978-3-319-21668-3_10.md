abstract: Given a specification and a set of candidate programs (program space), the program synthesis problem is to find a candidate program that satisfies
  the specification. We present the synthesis through unification (STUN) approach, which is an extension of the counter-example guided inductive synthesis
  (CEGIS) approach. In CEGIS, the synthesizer maintains a subset S of inputs and a candidate program \textbackslash \textdollar \textbackslash \textdollar
  \textbackslash backslashmathtt \textbackslash Prog\textbackslash \textbackslash \textdollar \textbackslash \textdollar that is correct for S. The synthesizer
  repeatedly checks if there exists a counterexample input c such that the execution of \textbackslash \textdollar \textbackslash \textdollar \textbackslash
  backslashmathtt \textbackslash Prog\textbackslash \textbackslash \textdollar \textbackslash \textdollar is incorrect on c. If so, the synthesizer enlarges
  S to include c, and picks a program from the program space that is correct for the new set S.
