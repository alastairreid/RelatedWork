abstract: Compilers should be correct. To improve the quality of C compilers, we created Csmith, a randomized test-case generation tool, and spent three
  years using it to find compiler bugs. During this period we reported more than 325 previously unknown bugs to compiler developers. Every compiler we tested
  was found to crash and also to silently generate wrong code when presented with valid input. In this paper we present our compiler-testing tool and the
  results of our bug-hunting study. Our first contribution is to advance the state of the art in compiler testing. Unlike previous tools, Csmith generates
  programs that cover a large subset of C while avoiding the undefined and unspecified behaviors that would destroy its ability to automatically find wrong-code
  bugs. Our second contribution is a collection of qualitative and quantitative results about the bugs we have found in open-source C compilers.
