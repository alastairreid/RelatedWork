abstract: Optimizing compilers rely on peephole optimizations to simplify   combinations of instructions and remove redundant instructions.   Typically,
  a new peephole optimization is added when a compiler   developer notices an optimization opportunity--a collection of   dependent instructions that can
  be improved--and manually derives a   more general rewrite rule that optimizes not only the original code,   but also other, similar collections of instructions.   In
  this paper, we present Hydra, a tool that automates the process of   generalizing peephole optimizations using a collection of techniques   centered on
  program synthesis.   One of the most important problems we have solved is finding a version   of each optimization that is independent of the bitwidths
  of the   optimization's inputs (when this version exists).   We show that Hydra can generalize 75\% of the ungeneralized missed   peephole optimizations
  that LLVM developers have posted to the LLVM   project's issue tracker.   All of Hydra's generalized peephole optimizations have been formally   verified,
  and furthermore we can automatically turn them into C++ code   that is suitable for inclusion in an LLVM pass.
