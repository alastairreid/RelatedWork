abstract: Many SMT solvers implement efficient SAT-based procedures for solving fixed-size bit-vector formulas. These approaches, however, cannot be used
  directly to reason about bit-vectors of symbolic bit-width. To address this shortcoming, we propose a translation from bit-vector formulas with parametric
  bit-width to formulas in a logic supported by SMT solvers that includes non-linear integer arithmetic, uninterpreted functions, and universal quantification.
  While this logic is undecidable, this approach can still solve many formulas by capitalizing on advances in SMT solving for non-linear arithmetic and
  universally quantified formulas. We provide several case studies in which we have applied this approach with promising results, including the bit-width
  independent verification of invertibility conditions, compiler optimizations, and bit-vector rewrites.
