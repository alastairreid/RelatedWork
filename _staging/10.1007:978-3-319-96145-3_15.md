abstract: Program synthesis is the mechanised construction of software. One of the main difficulties is the efficient exploration of the very large solution
  space, and tools often require a user-provided syntactic restriction of the search space. We propose a new approach to program synthesis that combines
  the strengths of a counterexample-guided inductive synthesizer with those of a theory solver, exploring the solution space more efficiently without relying
  on user guidance. We call this approach CEGIS(\textbackslash \textdollar \textbackslash \textdollar \textbackslash backslashmathcal \textbackslash T\textbackslash
  \textbackslash \textdollar \textbackslash \textdollar T), where \textbackslash \textdollar \textbackslash \textdollar \textbackslash backslashmathcal
  \textbackslash T\textbackslash \textbackslash \textdollar \textbackslash \textdollar Tis a first-order theory. In this paper, we focus on one particular
  challenge for program synthesizers, namely the generation of programs that require non-trivial constants. This is a fundamentally difficult task for state-of-the-art
  synthesizers. We present two exemplars, one based on Fourier-Motzkin (FM) variable elimination and one based on first-order satisfiability. We demonstrate
  the practical value of CEGIS(\textbackslash \textdollar \textbackslash \textdollar \textbackslash backslashmathcal \textbackslash T\textbackslash \textbackslash
  \textdollar \textbackslash \textdollar T) by automatically synthesizing programs for a set of intricate benchmarks.
