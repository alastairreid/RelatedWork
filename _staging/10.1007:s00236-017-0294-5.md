abstract: Formal synthesis is the process of generating a program satisfying a high-level formal specification. In recent times, effective formal synthesis
  methods have been proposed based on the use of inductive learning. We refer to this class of methods that learn programs from examples as formal inductive
  synthesis. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework for formal inductive synthesis. We discuss how formal inductive synthesis differs from traditional
  machine learning. We then describe oracle-guided inductive synthesis (OGIS), a framework that captures a family of synthesizers that operate by iteratively
  querying an oracle. An instance of OGIS that has had much practical impact is counterexample-guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS). We present a theoretical
  characterization of CEGIS for learning any program that computes a recursive language. In particular, we analyze the relative power of CEGIS variants
  where the types of counterexamples generated by the oracle varies. We also consider the impact of bounded versus unbounded memory available to the learning
  algorithm. In the special case where the universe of candidate programs is finite, we relate the speed of convergence to the notion of teaching dimension
  studied in machine learning theory. Altogether, the results of the paper take a first step towards a theoretical foundation for the emerging field of
  formal inductive synthesis.
