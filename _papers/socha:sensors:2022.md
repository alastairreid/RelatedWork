abstract: Side-channel analysis has become a widely recognized threat to the security of cryptographic implementations. Different side-channel attacks,
  as well as countermeasures, have been proposed in the literature. Such attacks pose a severe threat to both hardware and software cryptographic implementations,
  especially in the IoT environment where the attacker may easily gain physical access to a device, leaving it vulnerable to tampering. In this paper, we
  provide a comprehensive survey regarding the non-invasive passive side-channel analysis. We describe both non-profiled and profiled attacks, related security
  metrics, countermeasures against such attacks, and leakage-assessment methodologies, as available in the literature of more than twenty years of research.
