abstract: 'We have developed task scheduler logic (TSL) to automate reasoning about scheduling and concurrency in systems software. TSL can detect race
  conditions and other errors as well as supporting lock inference: the derivation of an appropriate lock implementation for each critical section in a
  system. Lock inference solves a number of problems in creating flexible, reliable, and efficient systems software. TSL is based on a notion of asymmetrical
  preemption relations and it exploits the hierarchical inheritance of scheduling properties that is common in systems software.'
