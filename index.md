This site contains [short summaries of papers]({% link papers/index.html %})
related to what I am working on or that I am thinking about.

The goal is to create [mini research surveys]({% link topics/index.html %})
in different areas.
These will probably not be comprehensive, will certainly be skewed by whatever my interest
in a field may be and flawed by the fact that I will typically an
outsider/newcomer to the field struggling to make sense of what I am reading
and to find the important papers in a sea of publications.

At the moment, this is just an experiment.
I have not yet decided whether to publicise it or to keep it just for my
personal use.
What would I do if somebody wanted to contribute to it?
What would I do if I really disliked a paper that I read?
I might just delete it tomorrow.

That said, if you are an author and feel that I misunderstood your paper,
I am happy (eager!) to correct details if you want to get in touch.

The tooling around this site is pretty simple at the moment: I have repurposed
the Jekyll material from my website (which is based on
[Barry Clark's Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now))
and I have a Python script that converts BibTeX entries to page templates.
But ideally this would be much more integrated with one or more of the main
research search engines like Google Scholar - perhaps as some form of overlay over
the basic website.
